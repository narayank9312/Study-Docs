Since I'm unable to access the video directly, here's a detailed explanation of the concepts likely covered in "FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS ðŸ”¥ft. Anonymous Functions | Namaste JavaScript Ep. 13". This includes points, diagrams, flowcharts, and code examples.

### Key Points:

1. **First-Class Functions**:
   - Functions in JavaScript are treated as first-class citizens.
   - They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.

2. **Anonymous Functions**:
   - Functions without a name.
   - Often used in situations where a function is used only once or as a callback.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   - Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their results.

4. **Callback Functions**:
   - Functions passed as arguments to other functions and executed after some operation is completed.

### Code Examples:

**Example 1: Assigning a Function to a Variable**:
```javascript
const sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
sayHello(); // Output: Hello!
```

**Example 2: Passing a Function as an Argument**:
```javascript
function greet(callback) {
  callback();
}
greet(sayHello); // Output: Hello!
```

**Example 3: Returning a Function from Another Function**:
```javascript
function createGreeting() {
  return function() {
    console.log("Hi!");
  };
}
const greet = createGreeting();
greet(); // Output: Hi!
```

### Detailed Flowchart:

**1. First-Class Functions**:
   - Functions are treated as values and can be manipulated like any other object.

```plaintext
+-----------------------------+
| const sayHello = function() |
|-----------------------------|
| sayHello()                  |
+-----------------------------+
```

**2. Higher-Order Function with Callback**:
   - A function that accepts another function as an argument.

```plaintext
+-----------------------------+
| function greet(callback)    |
| callback()                  |
+-----------------------------+
```

**3. Returning Functions**:
   - Demonstrates the ability of functions to return other functions.

```plaintext
+-----------------------------+
| function createGreeting()   |
| return function()           |
|-----------------------------|
| const greet = createGreeting|
| greet()                     |
+-----------------------------+
```

### Summary:

- **First-Class Functions**: Functions in JavaScript can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- **Anonymous Functions**: Functions without names, often used as arguments to other functions.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Callback Functions**: Functions passed as arguments and executed after an operation is completed.
