Find Intersection of two unsorted arrays.

#### You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Rotting Oranges

#### You have been given a grid containing some oranges. Each cell of this grid has one of the three integers values:

#### - Value 0 - representing an empty cell.

#### - Value 1 - representing a fresh orange.

#### - Value 2 - representing a rotten orange.

#### Every second, any fresh orange that is adjacent(4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

#### Your task is to find out the minimum time after which no cell has a fresh orange. If it's impossible to rot all the fresh oranges then print -1.

Palindrome Linked List

#### You are given a singly Linked List of integers. Your task is to return true if the given singly linked list is a palindrome otherwise returns false.

##### For example


 Ways to make Coin Change

#### You are given an infinite supply of coins of each of denominations D = {D0, D1, D2, D3, ...... Dn-1}. You need to figure out the total number of ways W, in which you can make a change for value V using coins of denominations from D. Print 0, if a change isn't possible.

##### Input Format


Power of 2

#### You are given an integer ‘N’. We can reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

#### Return true if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two. Else, return false.



Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

#### Given a string 'S' of length 'L', return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


Trapping Rain Water

#### You have been given a long type array/list 'ARR' of size 'N'. It represents an elevation map wherein 'ARR[i]' denotes the elevation of the 'ith' bar. Print the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped in these elevations


 Merge Intervals

#### You are given N number of intervals, where each interval contains two integers denoting the start time and the end time for the interval.

#### The task is to merge all the overlapping intervals and return the list of merged intervals sorted by increasing order of their start time.

#### Two intervals [A,B] and [C,D] are said to be overlapping with each other if there is at least one integer that is covered by both of them.


Search an element in a sorted and rotated array

#### Aahad and Harshit always have fun by solving problems. Harshit took a sorted array and rotated it clockwise by an unknown amount. For example, he took a sorted array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and if he rotates it by 2, then the array becomes: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].

#### After rotating a sorted array, Aahad needs to answer Q queries asked by Harshit, each of them is described by one integer Q[i]. which Harshit wanted him to search in the array. For each query, if he found it, he had to shout the index of the number, otherwise, he had to shout -1.

#### For each query, you have to complete the given method where 'key' denotes Q[i]. If the key exists in the array, return the index of the 'key', otherwise, return -1.



Queue Using Stack

#### Implement a queue data structure which follows FIFO(First In First Out) property, using only the instances of the stack data structure.


 Diameter Of Binary Tree

#### You are given a Binary Tree. You are supposed to return the length of the diameter of the tree.

#### The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two end nodes in a tree.


Check if two strings are anagram of each other

#### Pre-requisites: Anagrams are defined as words or names that can be formed by rearranging letters of another word. Such as "spar" can be formed by rearranging letters of "rasp". Hence, "spar" and "rasp" are anagrams.


Given three arrays sorted in non-decreasing order, print all common elements in these arrays. Examples: ar1[] = {1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80} ar2[] = {6, 7, 20, 80, 100} ar3[] = {3, 4, 15, 20, 30, 70, 80, 120} Output: 20, 80

Given an array of integers which can be in one of four order – i.Increasing 2.Decreasing 3.decreasing then increasing 4.increasing then decreasing .Write a function to find the type of array
